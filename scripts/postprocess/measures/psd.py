    Parameters
    ----------
    filelist: list
              a list of file path in .fif format
    start_freq: float
                min frequency of interest
    end_freq: float
              max frequency of interest
    bands: dict
           a dictionary with a key per band of interest ("delta", "theta" etc.), each containing a list of
           starting freq and ending freq ([1,4], [4,8] etc.).
    tmin: float
          min time of interest
    tmax: float
          max time of interest
    pick_elec: a list of strings
               names of the electrode of interest
    n_fft: int
           The length of FFT used, must be >= n_per_seg (default: 256). The segments will be zero-padded
           if n_fft > n_per_seg. If n_per_seg is None, n_fft must be <= number of time points in the data.
    n_per_seg: int
               Length of each Welch segment (windowed with a Hamming window).
               Defaults to None, which sets n_per_seg equal to n_fft.
    average: str
             How to average the segments. If mean (default), calculate the arithmetic mean.
             If median, calculate the median, corrected for its bias relative to the mean.
             If None, returns the unaggregated segments.
